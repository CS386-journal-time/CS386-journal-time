## 1. System Description

Our memories can be greatly enhanced by including more context and information within our personal journals.  Currently, adding information beyond written entries requires significant effort by the individual, and a simple journal misses out on so much content, data, and other available information that is available on a smartphone.  For people who appreciate logging experiences from their day, Journal Time is mobile app that helps users create enhanced personal journal entries that better capture and preserve their most important memories.  Journal Time allows users to add customized information, such as photos, social media posts, and news stories, from their smartphone or from their internet accounts to their daily journal entries.  This information is then organized in an attractive digital layout that can be utilized and shared in different manners.  

The key requirements for Journal Time begin with the need for a **calendar display** that allows the user to select an appropriate **day** to _view or edit_ that **journal entry**.  Each **journal entry** will contain a **journal text box** where the user can _enter and edit_ their own *text*.  Below the **journal text box** the user will have the ability to include additional enhanced information to that journal entry.  In one **section**, the user can select **photos** from their camera roll to _include_ in the journal entry that will also include information on the photo such as *time* and *location*.  Another section will _display_ of **events** from the users calendar (**calendar events**) or events that the user _manually enters_ (**manual events**).  The app will also _figure_ out the users **location** and post an *image of the location* on a map.
