## 1. Description

Journal Time is a journal-taking mobile application that integrates information, such as photos, locations, and contacts into entries to provide context. The users of this application can avoid leaving out important information in their entries by providing contextual information already within their phone and the internet. When using Journal Time, the user will log into their account and view a calendar where they can select the date that they would like to make an entry for. From here, the user can type their entry into a text box, customizing the font and color of their text as well as the background of the overall entry. 


Users can also enter photos from their camera or camera roll into entries, as well as their location. Their entry will be saved to their account through the server where they can later access and edit it through their phone or another device. Users also get the chance to share what is going on in their lives through sharing their entries. Users can either email or text PDF versions of their entries to any friends or family they would like.
