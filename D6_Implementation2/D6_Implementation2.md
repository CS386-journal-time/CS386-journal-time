# D6 Implementation_2

## 1. Description

Journal Time is a journal-taking mobile application that integrates information, such as photos, locations, and contacts into entries to provide context. The users of this application can avoid leaving out important information in their entries by providing contextual information already within their phone and the internet. When using Journal Time, the user will log into their account and view a calendar where they can select the date that they would like to make an entry for. From here, the user can type their entry into a text box, customizing the font and color of their text as well as the background of the overall entry.

Users can also enter photos from their camera or camera roll into entries, as well as their location. Their entry will be saved to their account through the server where they can later access and edit it through their phone or another device. Users also get the chance to share what is going on in their lives through sharing their entries. Users can either email or text PDF versions of their entries to any friends or family they would like.

## 4. Code Quality

Maintaining code across the users was somewhat challenging even when utilizing Git.  First, some
team members had trouble getting the root project to run properly.  This encouraged us to rethink how to store Android Projects on Git.  We ended up storing the projects in a folder within Git and this seemed to fix the first issue.  However, there are real challenges in such time compressed project.  As our team simultaneously worked on different aspects of the project such as features, backend, and user interface, there was always additional effort in merging different branches.  For example, when certain aspects of the backend needed to get updated, it changed some of the design of our classes and required updates in the UI to be done manually.   

We also recognize a need to do better commenting within our code.  Our class names and variables are really good, but there could be better opportunity to explain certain functions and aspects of the code.  It would also be helpful as we improve and update the App.  

Overall, the team put in a good effort to work through issues and continues to implement and improve our strategies to ensure code quality.
