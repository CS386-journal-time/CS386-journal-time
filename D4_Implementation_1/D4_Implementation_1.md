# D4. Implementation 1


## 1. Introduction

Journal Time is a mobile application that allows users to write personalized journal entries. Journal Time helps users create enhanced personal journal entries that better capture and preserve their most important memories unlike any other journaling or note-taking app, allowing its users to add customized information like photos locations, and news stories.

With Journal Time, users can create journal entries by going into a calendar and selecting their desired day to journal. From here, the journal-taker uses a text box to type in their entry, customize the text color and font for their entry, enter photos from their camera roll, and list their location at the time of writing.

## 2. Implemented requirements

* **Calendar Display** using the table_calendar package

* **Basic Navigation**

* **Text Box for a Journal Entry**

* **Ability to select a photo from the smartphone**

## 3. Adopted technologies

**Flutter SDK with Dart programming language on Android Studio platform.**  Flutter / Dart was developed to allow the creation of mobile apps that work on both Android and iOS with limited to no customization required.  Flutter was the obvious choice for the SDK from a technical perspective and several team members had experience with Android Studio.

**Mobile Device Standards** Our primary testing will be done on a Nexus 6 virtual device.  However, with the nature of Flutter, we will also be doing secondary testing on other virtual devices and physical devices including at least one Android tablet.

**AWS** Linux Server with Docker Image of Firebase

**Backend**

**Docker**

## 4. Learning/training

Different members of the team have different levels of skill and background with different technologies.  Given the short timelines of the class project, we have decided to initially divide tasks based on team member background.  In the early stages it is expected that leads will provide assistance and learning materials to the team stages as well as oversee successful implementation.  As the project develops we have started shifting responsibilities so that each member of the team can gain broader exposure to the different technologies.
