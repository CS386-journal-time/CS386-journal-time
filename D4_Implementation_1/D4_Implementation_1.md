## 3. Adopted technologies

**Flutter SDK with Dart programming language on Android Studio platform.**  Flutter / Dart was developed to allow the creation of mobile apps that work on both Android and iOS with limited to no customization required.  Flutter was the obvious choice for the SDK from a technical perspective and several team members had experience with Android Studio.

**Mobile Device Standards** Our primary testing will be done on a Nexus 6 virtual device.  However, with the nature of Flutter, we will also be doing secondary testing on other virtual devices and physical devices including at least one Android tablet.

**AWS**

**Backend**

## 4. Learning/training

Different members of the team have different levels of skill and background with different technologies.  Given the short timelines of the class project, we have decided to initially divide tasks based on team member background.  In the early stages it is expected that leads will provide assistance and learning materials to the team stages as well as oversee successful implementation.  As the project develops we have started shifting responsibilities so that each member of the team can gain broader exposure to the different technologies.
